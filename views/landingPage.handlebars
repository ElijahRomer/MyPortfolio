        of my work, I can quicky learn new
        skills and workflows to adapt and meet the demands of the job, and the team in which I am participating. My
        motto for life is
        "Perpetuam uitae, doctrina" which is latin for "Lifelong Learning". When the path forward is unclear, it's time
        to hit the books, (or consult the documentation).

        <strong>My strengths include:</strong>
        <li>Coachability.</li>
        <li>Teamwork skills from previous collaborative work experience.</li>
        <li>Positivity in the face of adversity.</li>
        <li>Thriving under pressure.</li>
        <li>Planning, strategizing, and executing to meet deadlines.</li>
        <li>Attention to writing clean, maintainable code.</li>

        When I am not coding, I'm usually traveling, skydiving, or both! I love any and all things that
        expand my horizons and introduce me to new experiences and ideas. My favorite pastime is learning for the sake
        of learning, which I feel complements the realm of software development quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite adventure to date has been skydiving and learning the intricacies of the gear, weather conditions,
        landing in different terrain, and risk management- as if my life depended on it! This is an environment in which
        I thrive quite well:
        the need for attention to detail, coachability, and to learn quickly. There is little room for performance
        anxiety whilst plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour, and adapting on the fly is a foundational key to
        success in all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream is to someday prove myself enough in the software and web development industry to be able to work
        virtually and become a digital nomad-
        traveling/ living abroad and working full-time simultaneously. If given the chance to prove what I am capable
        of, I <i>guarantee</i> you will not be dissappointed.
