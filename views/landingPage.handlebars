        of my work, I am highly motivated to meet customer specifications and deadlines; I can quicky learn new
        skills to meet those specifications when called for. My modis-operandi is attention and dedication to detail and
        in turn, professionalism. When the path forward is unclear, it's time to start learning.

      <ul>
        <strong>My strengths include:</strong>
        <li>Coachability.</li>
        <li>Teamwork skills from previous collaborative work experience.</li>
        <li>Positivity in the face of adversity.</li>

        <li>Planning, strategizing, and executing to meet deadlines.</li>

        When I am not coding, I'm usually traveling, skydiving, or both! I love any and all things that
        expand my horizons and introduce me to new experiences and ideas. My favorite pastime is learning for the sake
        of learning, which I feel complements the realm of software development quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite adventure to date has been skydiving and learning the intricacies of the gear, weather conditions,
        terrain, and risk management- as if my life depended on it! This is an environment in which I thrive quite well:
        the need for attention to detail, coachability, and to learn quickly. There is little room for performance
        anxiety and rolling with the punches is the greatest key to success.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream is to someday prove myself enough in the software and web development industry to be able to work
        virtually and become a digital nomad-
        traveling/ living abroad and working full-time simultaneously. If given the chance to prove what I am capable
        of, I guarantee you will not be dissappointed or your money back!
