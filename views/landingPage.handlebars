      <h4>Who is this guy?</h4>
      <p class="">I'm a full-stack web developer, and I have devoted the last 9 months devoted to learning
        computer science, focusing on contemporary web and software development.</p>

      <p>As I believe you will find in the examples
        of my work, I can quicky learn new
        skills and workflows to adapt and meet the demands of the job, and the team in which I am participating.</p>
      <strong>
        <p> My
          motto for not just software development, but for life is
          "Perpetuam uitae, doctrina" which is latin for "Lifelong Learning". When the path forward is unclear, it's
          time
          to hit the books, (or consult the documentation).</p>
      </strong>

      <p>In addition to the standard bootcamp curriculum, I have put significant hours towards learning development
        methodology, the git version control system, understanding JavaScript on a fundamental level,
        algorithms/ big O notation, OS tools and tricks, basic data-structures and science, CPU
        operation, fundamentals of electrical engineering, computer architecture, and of course the history of computers
        - you can call me a Turing fan-boy.</p>

      <p>I believe this gives me a broad context, enabling me to pick up new technologies faster, and keeping me
        grounded yet flexible in the face of the evolving technological landscape.</p>

    <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
    <div class="my-1 col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
      <p class="">
        When I am not coding, I'm usually traveling, skydiving, or both! I love any and all things that
        expand my horizons and introduce me to new experiences and ideas. My favorite pastime is learning for the sake
        of learning, which I feel complements the realm of software development quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
        My favorite adventure to date has been skydiving and learning the intricacies of the gear, weather conditions,
        landing in different terrain, and risk management- as if my life depended on it! This is an environment in which
        I thrive quite well:
        the need for attention to detail, coachability, and to learn quickly. There is little room for performance
        anxiety whilst plummeting to earth at 120 miles per hour, and adapting on the fly is a foundational key to
        success in all things.
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream is to someday prove myself enough in the software and web development industry to be able to work
        virtually and become a digital nomad-
        traveling/ living abroad and working full-time simultaneously. If given the chance to prove what I am capable
        of, I <i>guarantee</i> you will not be dissappointed.
