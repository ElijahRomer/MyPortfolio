    <h4>Wandir</h4>
    <p> An app for organizing and meeting with other people who are passionate about travel. This project was my first
      real step into
      creating an application utilizing MVC architecture. It was a sprint to complete as much functionality as possible
      in
      the span of two weeks, with 3 other team members. A very enjoyable learning experience. I was tasked with building
      most of the back end, and managing
      the git workflow from individual feature branches on up to the main branch and deployment via Heroku.</p>
